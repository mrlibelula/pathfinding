# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer! This project is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a visual representation of two popular pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Features

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** An algorithm that explores all nodes at the present "depth" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It's simple and guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** A more advanced algorithm that finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It's widely used in network routing and geographic mapping.

You can see the visualizer in action on the [demo site](https://pathfinding.libe.dev).
